Basic project skeleton

# Todo:

- hot reloading
- app config file which can house stuff to be bundled by webpack with special cases
  - e.g. styles like with angular cli
- verbose linting rules file

# Stretch goals

- add in linting check pre-commit?
  - maybe make this optional as it can get annoying
- optional redux
- cli prompts like npm init
